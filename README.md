# QlikSense-GitFlow

##Project Name						
Integrate Qlik into git branching strategy						
Project Objective						
Use git to manage Qlick development and build Qlick applications using jenkins to enable integration with gitflow process and automatically build using Jenkins						


##Expected Timeline						
3 months						
Project Description						
As part of the DNA objectives to move toward CI/CD in dev ops, we need to implement a strategy to enable Qlik development with Git. Currently, the process requires the project/application to be built a binary and then checked in. This doesnâ€™t allow the team to do diffs between releases or read the code in text format. We want to investigate if it is possible to align Qlick with standard development processes and consistent with an overall git flow development process						




##Expected Outcomes						
"1. Ability to build git applictions in jenkins
2. Merge Qlik applications to different branches and rebuild
3. Remove the need for checking in binary files"
